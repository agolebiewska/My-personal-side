                      <span align="justifyr"> PARIS — “Grid kids” are replacing “grid girls” in Formula One as the motorsport series continues to change ahead of the new season.</p>
                      <p align="justify">F1 says youngsters from motorsport clubs, who for example are already competing in karting, will stand alongside drivers on the grid before <br> 
                        races this season.</p>
                      <p align="justify">Monday’s announcement comes after the series said last week ended the long-standing practice of using women on the grid, and on the podium <br>
                        with the top three drivers, because this no longer fits in with Formula One’s values and societal norms. </p>
                      <p aling="justify">The latest initiative is joint venture by the FIA — motorsport’s governing body — and F1’s owners. </p>
                      <p aling="justify">FIA President Jean Todt says “Grid Kids” gives “future champions of our sport the opportunity to stand alongside their heroes.”</p>
                      <p aling="justify">Sean Bratches, F1’s managing director of commercial operations, adds: “What better way to inspire the next generation of Formula 1 heroes.”</p>
                      <p aling="justify">F1 is owned by Liberty Media, which is changing the way the sport is run since taking over from former commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone in January 2017.</p>
                      <p aling="justify">The season starts on March 25 at the Australian Grand Prix.</p>
